            <h2>Bon! French Cafe</h2>
            <p>
              Parisian cafés typically serve as a center of social and culinary
              life in Paris. They have existed since the 17th century and can
              serve as a meeting place, neighborhood hub, conversation matrix,
              rendez-vous spot, and a place to relax or to refuel for Parisian
              citizens.[1] Typical Parisian cafés are not coffee shops, instead
              generally coming with a complete kitchen offering a restaurant
              menu with meals for any time of the day. Many also feature a full
              bar and even a wine selection. Among the drinks customarily served
              are the "grande crème" (large cup of white coffee), wine by the
              glass, beer ("un demi", half a pint, or "une pression", a glass of
              draught beer), "un pastis" (made with aniseed flavour spirit), and
              "un espresso" (a small cup of black coffee). [2] In many cases,
              the café sometimes doubles as a "bureau de tabac", a tobacco shop
              that sells a wide variety of merchandise, including metro tickets
              and prepaid phone cards. Some of the most recognizable Paris cafés
              include Café de la Paix, Les Deux Magots, Café de Flore, Café de
              la Rotonde, La Coupole, Fouquet's, Le Deauville, as well as a new
              wave represented by Café Beaubourg and Drugstore Publicis. The
              oldest still in operation is the Café Procope, which opened in
              1686. [Random French Cafe Description]

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
              Coffee was introduced to Paris in 1644 by Pasqua Rosée, who opened
              the first café in Paris on Place Saint-Germain,[3] but the concept
              did not become successful until the opening of Café Procope in
              about 1689 in rue des Fossés-Saint-Germain, close to the
              Comédie-Française.[4] The café served coffee, tea, chocolate,
              liqueurs, ice cream, and confiture in a luxurious setting. The
              Café Procope was frequented by Voltaire (when he was not in
              exile), Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Diderot and D’Alembert.[5] Cafés
              became important centers for exchanging news, rumors and ideas and
              were often more reliable than newspapers.[6] In 1723 there were
              about 323 cafés in Paris; by 1790, there were more than 1,800.
              They were places for meeting friends and for literary and
              political discussion.[7] Hurtaut and Magny wrote in their
              ‘’Dictionnaire de Paris’’ in 1779: "One gets the news there,
              either by conversation or by reading the newspapers. You don’t
              have to encounter anyone with bad morals, no loud persons, no
              soldiers, no domestics, no one who could trouble the tranquility
              of society."[8] Women rarely entered cafés, but women of the
              nobility sometimes stopped their carriages outside and were served
              inside the carriage with cups on silver platters. During the
              Revolution, the cafés turned into centers of furious political
              discussion and activity, often led by members of the Revolutionary
              clubs.[9] Following the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars,
              billiard rooms were added to some famous 18th-century cafés in
              Paris and other cities.

              "There is nothing about the Paris streets which more definitely
              strikes the British or American visitor than the café life on the
              pavements ... The Paris café remains in their minds as the typical
              café--something so foreign that there is no equivalent for its
              name in the English language. The old English coffee-house was not
              a café in the modern sense, and it has vanished now. So is also
              vanishing the Paris café in its most characteristic form. There
              was a time when the best thought of France, in the arts and in
              politics, was to be found round such and such tables in such and
              such a café. The Frenchman's café was his club... The cafés of
              Paris are no longer part of her intellectual life, but they are
              certainly the chief feature of her streets; on pavements hardly
              wide enough for a honeymoon couple to walk on, a flimsy chair and
              an oak-grained tin table will defend against all-comers the right
              of every good Frenchman to enjoy upon the very streets of the
              loved city his Byrrh--and Frankincense."--George and Pearl Adam A
              Book about Paris. London: Jonathan Cape, 1927.
